# Goodreads — Exploratory Data Analysis and Discovering Relationships
The objective behind analyzing the Goodreads dataset is to get a fair idea about the relationships between the multiple attributes a book might have, such as: the average rating of books weighted by multiple factors, the performance of authors over the years, discover books with fake ratings, and find factors that ensure a book’s success in today’s age.

Does any relationship lie between ratings and the total ratings given?<br>
Where do majority of the books lie, in terms of ratings - Does reading a book really bring forth bias for the ratings?<br>
Do authors tend to perform same over time, with all their newer books? Or do they just fizzle out.<br>
Do number of pages make an impact on reading styles, ratings and popularity?<br>
Can books be recommended based on ratings? Is that a factor which can work?
